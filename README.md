# Jet-Matching-Plot-
This repository contains MATLAB code for generating a matching plot to analyze jet engine performance in the preliminary design phase. The plot visualizes the relationship between thrust, altitude, speed, and specific fuel consumption (SFC), helping optimize the engine's propulsion system for efficiency and performance.

Key Features:

1.Generates a matching plot based on jet engine performance.
2.Accounts for variables like thrust, speed, altitude, and specific fuel consumption.
3.Helps in the selection of optimal operating points for maximum performance and efficiency.

Reference:
This analysis is based on the measurement principles outlined in Sadrey's Book on Unmanned Aircraft Design: A Review of Fundamentals(2017), which provides the theoretical foundation and practical methodology for matching jet propulsion systems to UAV performance.
