# Jet-Matching-Plot-
This repository contains MATLAB code for generating a matching plot to analyze jet engine performance in the preliminary design phase. The plot visualizes the relationship between thrust, altitude, speed, and specific fuel consumption (SFC), helping optimize the engine's propulsion system for efficiency and performance.
